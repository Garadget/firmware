# Firmware
Garadget is the garage door "futurizer". It allows to monitor and operate your existing garage doors from smartphones, wearables and other devices. It's inexpensive, easy to install and developer friendly. For more information please visit http://www.garadget.com

The code in this repository is for the program that controls Garaget's hardware. It's C++ application similar to those created for popular Arduino boards. You are encouraged to study it, report the problems, modify it, try it with your Garadget and share.

## Particle Platform
At the core of the device is Particle Photon P1 module allowing Garadget to benefit from:
- [powerful hardware](https://docs.particle.io/datasheets/p1-datasheet/#features)
- [feature rich firmware libraries](https://docs.particle.io/reference/firmware/photon/)
- LAN and Internet connectivity
- [numerous developer resources](https://docs.particle.io/guide/tools-and-features/dev/)

## Communication Protocol
Garadget communicates with the clients via Particle cloud by
- [exposing variables](https://docs.particle.io/reference/firmware/photon/#particle-variable-) to report status and configuration
- [accepting function calls](https://docs.particle.io/reference/firmware/photon/#particle-function-) to change status and update configuration
- [publishing events](https://docs.particle.io/reference/firmware/photon/#particle-publish-) to report status changes and send alerts

### Variable: doorStatus
String `status=%s|time=%u%c|sensor=%u|signal=%d` where
- `status` - is current status of the door such as `open`, `closed` etc
- `time` - time in that status 0-119s, 2-119m, 2-47h, 2+d
- `sensor` is the sensor reflection rate 0-100
- `base` raw photo-sensor reading 0-4095 (12 bit)
- `signal` is WiFi signal strength in dB

#### Door states (`status`)
- `closed`
- `open`
- `closing`
- `opening`
- `stopped`

### Variable: doorConfig
String `ver=%d.%d|cnt=%d|rdt=%d|mtt=%d|mot=%d|rlt=%d|rlp=%d|srr=%d|srt=%d|aev=%d|aot=%d|ans=%d|ane=%d|nme=%s` containing pipe separated value for firmware version and timing parameters (all numeric):
- `ver` - version, dot separated major and minor (currently 1.7)
- `rdt` - sensor scan interval in mS (200-60,000, default 1,000)
- `mtt` - door moving time in mS from completely opened to completely closed (1,000 - 120,000, default 10,000)
- `rlt` - button press time mS, time for relay to keep contacts closed (10-2,000, default 300)
- `rlp` - delay between consecutive button presses in mS (10-5,000 default 1,000)
- `srr` - number of sensor reads used in averaging (1-20, default 3)
- `srt` - reflection threshold below which the door is considered open (1-80, default 25)
- `aev` - number serving as bitmap for enabling status alerts. See details below.
- `aot` - alert for open timeout in seconds (0 disables, default 1,200 - 20min)
- `ans` - alert for night time start in minutes from midnight (same value as ane disables, default 1320 - 10pm)
- `ane` - alert for night time end in minutes from midnight (same value as ans disables, default 360 - 6am)
- `tzo` - time zone offset or daylight savings time (DST) rule for the region. See details below.
- `nme` - device name to be used in notifications. At reboot this value will be overwritten with the device name configured in Particle cloud. Update this value to notify the unit about the name change without reboot.

#### Status alerts bitmap (`aev`)
Bitmap values for `aev` parameter are:
- 0 - closed (adds 1)
- 1 - open (adds 2)
- 2 - closing (adds 4)
- 3 - opening (adds 8)
- 4 - stopped (adds 16)
- 5 - init (adds 32)
- 6 - online (adds 64)
- 7 - offline (adds 128)
- 8 - config (adds 256)

For example if we want to receive notifications about device opening, stopped and going offline, the value is 2^3 + 2^4 + 2^7 = 8 + 16 + 128 = 152. To determine if particular bit is set, use binary AND operation against the value of the bit. E.g. the condition for checking bit for `opening` is `if (value & 8)`.

#### Time zone configuration parameter (`tzo`)
- For areas without daylight savings time: float number for hours offset from UTC. Example `-7` or `-7.00`.
- If multiple regions have the same offset from UTC, additional character can be added at the end to help UI resolve ambiguity. Example: Region `ABC` is at the same UTC-7.00 offset as region `XYZ`. To correctly indicate current selection in UI, region `ABC` is assigned value `-7.00A` and region `XYZ` is assigned value `-7.00X`. The distinguishing character at the end is ignored by Garadget.
- For areas with daylight savings time: comma separated DST rules - first for the beginning of the standard time, second for the beginning of daylight savings time. DST rules are formatted as follows: 1 digit week number (0-last, 1-first, 2-second, 3-third, 4-forth), 1 digit week day (0-Sunday, 1-Monday, 2-Tuesday, etc.), 2 digit month number (1-January, 2-February, 3-March, etc.), 1 digit hour (0-for midnight, 1-1am etc), float number for hours offset from UTC. Example: In Colorado Mountain Standard Time (MST, UTC-7) starts on 1st Sunday in November at 2am, and Mountain Daylight Time (MDT, UTC-6) starts on 2nd Sunday in March at 2am. The value for Colorado is `10112-7.00,20032-6.00`
- If multiple regions have the same DST rules then additional character can be added comma separated at the end to help UI resolve ambiguity. Example: `10112-7.00,20032-6.00,A` for one and `10112-7.00,20032-6.00,B` for another.

### Variable: netConfig
String `ip=%d.%d.%d.%d|snet=%d.%d.%d.%d|gway=%d.%d.%d.%d|mac=%02X:%02X:%02X:%02X:%02X:%02X|ssid=%s` where
- `ip` - IP address
- `snet` - subnet
- `gway` - gateway
- `mac` - MAC address of the device

### Function: setState
Requests change of door state. As parameter the function receives a string containing a new state such as (`open`, `closed`, `stop`)

### Function: setConfig
Updates doorConfig parameters as listed above. As parameter the function receives a string containing pipe delimited values for `doorConfig` that need to be updated e.g. `srr=5|rlp=%d`. Omitted parameters will remain unchanged, the order of parameters is not important. The length is limited to 63 characters so the request for multiple changes may need to be split into multiple calls.

### Event: state
Published when state of the door changes, parameter is the new state. This event can be used to update the UI.

### Event: alert
Published when alert is generated or device configuration changes. Parameter is JSON with the type of alert and related data. Multiple alert types are supported:

#### state
Published when state of the door or device changes and alert for the new state is enabled in configuration (`aev` setting).
Example JSON: `{"name": "Home", "type": "state", data: "opening"}`

#### timeout
Published when door remains open longer than the configured timeout, parameter is the configured timeout (`aot` setting).
Example JSON: `{"name": "Home", "type": "timeout", "data": "20m"}`

#### night
Published when door remains opens at the beginning of the configured night period or opened during that period. Parameter is the configured time of start of the night period. Parameter is configured time range (`ans` and `ane` settings).
Example JSON: `{"name": "Home", "type": "night", "data": "1320-360"}`

#### config
Published when device configuration is updated, parameter is the updated configuration string.
Example JSON: `{"name": "Home", "type": "config", "data": "ans=1320|ane=360|tzo=-7.0"}`
